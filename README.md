Three variants of calculating the n-th term of the Fibonacci series. 

Input:

n - number of the sequence member

a1, a2 - the first 2 members of the sequence


Also are EIGHT sometimes slightly, sometimes more different variations of calculating Nth number of Fibonacci sequence.


V1 - functions and tests, with usual summary in loop

V2 - pseudo OOP, also with usual summary in loop

V3 - functions, with counting number of the member a2 in sequence and just adding the number of sequence member as steps

V4 - short version of above

Honestly, there are only two versions that are slightly different.
